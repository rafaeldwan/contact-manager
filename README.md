# Contact Manager
### Using Localstorage, Handlebars, and jQuery

From this LaunchSchool Assignment:
> Implement the Contact Manager app here:

> http://devsaran.github.io/contact-manager-backbone/

> You should implement all the features there, including the search. In addition, also implement a "tagging" feature, which allows you to create tags, such as "marketing", "sales", "engineering", and when you add/edit a contact, you can select a tag to attach to the contact. Finally, you can click on a tag and show all the contacts with that tag. The UI isn't too important here, but focus on the functionality.
